# Mechanics
üìú This folder is designed to organize all robot mechanics-related content for the [team](https://github.com/franrobots), competing in the Rescue Maze category at RoboCup Junior. <br>

It contains essential documents, photos, and CAD ([SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/)) project files. <br>
<br>

> ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical development involves creating a **robust** structure, an **efficient** locomotion system, a **reliable** firing mechanism, and integrating precise electronic sensors to build an **effective** robot for competition.
