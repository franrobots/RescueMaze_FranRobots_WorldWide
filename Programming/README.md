# Programming

ðŸ“œ This folder is intended for content related to the programming of the [team](https://www.instagram.com/fran_robots/) used in the Rescue Maze competition. <br>

Included here are the documents, photos, and the code used in the robot. <br>
<br>

> ðŸ“º The programming utilizes C++ to control the robot's movement and Python to process images. <br> <br>
ðŸ“· Instead of using artificial intelligence, we constructed the **entire** architecture with the help of OpenCV, an **open-source** library that enables real-time image manipulation.
